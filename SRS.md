## Abstract:

With the advent of digital media readers are overwhelmed with the volume of news and information available on the internet. An individual is left to navigate the numerous news websites and articles alone, and often finds himself lost in the massive amount of information. Our news aggregator web app, FeedMe, aims to simplify the news reading experience for people by acting as a one-stop-shop for the latest news from a variety of publishers, categories and  geographies. Moreover, FeedMe will allow the reader  to have complete control on the categories, locations and publishers he receives news from, with the flexibility of modifying his subscription as he wishes. Thus, we don’t just simplify, we empower the reader.


## Customer and Competitive analysis

Several apps and websites such as Google Current, RSS feeds, Flipboard, Pulse etc. have attempted to aggregate the news for the reader. However, most of them have either been discontinued or do not provide sufficient user interaction, resulting in readers resorting to social media websites such as Twitter to get their news, which allows the user a high degree of interaction.

Unlike existing news feeds, FeedMe will not only provide a platform for users to read trending news, but also allow them to engage with it and express their opinions. It will provide the perfect intersection between news-reading and social engagement.
In just one simple step, users will be able to create an account on FeedMe and customize their subscriptions by determining which publishers, categories,  and geographic locations they wish to receive news from. Moreover, once users have an account they will be able to share their favorite news articles on social media, write blogs to express their perspectives and receive notifications.

By combing news-reading with the ability to engage with the content, FeedMe will immensely simplify the user’s experience.

While traditional news feed sites target avid news readers, our web app simplifies news-reading so that everyone who wishes to read news can do so in a few simple steps, especially those who have traditionally felt overwhelmed by the volume of articles available online.
